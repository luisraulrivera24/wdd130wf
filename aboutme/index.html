    <h2>Luis Rivera</h2>
    <h2>Guicho</h2>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Luis Rivera, my nickname is "Guicho"! Some of the things I love to do is be in the outdoors, hike, spend<br>
        time with family, and watch youtube! I majored in 2021 in Public Policy and Administration, but wanted to come back to continue<br>
        my learning at BYU-I. The thing I love most about BYU-I are the people. I have met some of the best, kind, and selfless people in Idaho!<br>
        The spirit of ricks really makes the campus special to me!</p>
    
    <h3>Favorite Quote</h3>

    <p> A quote I really like is one that says,<br>
        "Try and keep on trying, until that which seems difficult becomes possible, and that which seems possible becomes habit and a real part of you"</p>
