      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my site is to provide trailer rentals. These rentals are
        for people who need to dispose of of any form of trash and need the proper
        equipment to do so since it is large amounts of trash, which can be difficult
        to transport.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience is people that need to dispose of trash. This can be from
        doing remodeling in their homes, or old junk in their garage. These trailer rentals
        are for people who do not have trailers and need them to dispose of the trash they have
        in their homes.
